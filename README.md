# Lottie React

This is an experiment to expose [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) as a
ReactXP extension.

Lottie is an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders After Effects
animations in real time, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use
static images. There is also a variant that works in a browser.

The reason for creating this etension is because the existing SVG extension
provided by Microsft does not implement the complete set of SVG elements.

## Getting Started

Lets start by installing the NPM dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

Next follow the
[Lottie RN Setup](http://airbnb.io/lottie/react-native/react-native.html).

Finally, run the story book on either Web:

```sh
npm run starybook-web
```

and/or Native:

```sh
npm run starybook-native
npm run ios
npm run android
```
